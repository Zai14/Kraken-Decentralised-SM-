# Kraken: Decentralized Secure Messaging Web App

Kraken is a decentralized, secure messaging web application built using React and TypeScript. It offers end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer messaging with Supabase as the backend, and MetaMask authentication for decentralized login. Kraken also integrates crypto wallet functionality, allowing users to view real-time cryptocurrency prices directly within the app.

- **Supabase**: A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that provides real-time database functionality, authentication, and user management.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension wallet for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains, used for decentralized authentication.
- **Web3.js**: Library for interacting with Ethereum-based blockchains, enabling wallet functionality and blockchain interactions.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast build tool for optimizing frontend development.
